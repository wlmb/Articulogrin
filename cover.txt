We submit the manuscript 'Analytical Model for the Current Density in
the Electrochemical Synthesis of Porous Silicon Structures with a
Lateral Gradient' by C. A. Ospina-Delacruz
et al.  to your consideration for publication as an original research
paper in the journal Materials Research Bulletin.

In this paper we develop a simple model that permits the
computation of the position dependent current density j(r) within an
electrolytic cell during the fabrication of porous Si (PS) structures. This
allows the characterization of the porosity and etching rate as a
function of j from a single or a small number of samples, which in
turn, allows the control of the index of refraction and width of PS
layers in gradient index (GRIN) devices with optical and structural properties that
depend on the lateral position. We illustrate our model by analyzing
three single layered samples produced on similar substrates with different total
etching currents. We believe our formalism will prove useful for the design and
fabrication of more complex multilayered non-homogeneous devices with
lateral gradients such as microcavities tuned to continuously varying
frequencies for sensing aplications, and thus, we consider they
will prove to be of interest for the readership of the journal.

Yours truly,

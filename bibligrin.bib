The orientational structure and energetic properties of the liquid have been studied for several choices of Ewald sum parameters. The results, including the dielectric constant epsilon-o, the radial-dependent Kirkwood factor G(k)(r), the orientational projection H-DELTA-(r), and the average dipole interaction energy, are compared with those from molecular dynamics simulations of water using the reaction field method. While the orientational structure of the liquid obtained from simulations which treat long range interactions by Ewald summation is different from corresponding results obtained from simulations with a reaction field, consistent values are calculated for the dielectric constant. The sensitivity of the results to variations in the convergence parameter alpha, the real-space cutoff R(c), and the number of vectors used in the reciprocal space sum was also analyzed.},

Then we use the developed theory to analyze the modes with real and complex wave number in a 3D periodic lattice of lead telluride (PbTe) microspheres at infrared frequencies and in a 3D periodic lattice of titanium dioxide (TiO2) microspheres at millimeter waves. Each microsphere is equivalently modeled with both an electric and a magnetic dipole, via a method here called the dual dipole approximation (DDA). The 3D lattices exhibit first a magnetic-induced then an electric-induced feature determined by microsphere magnetic and electric resonances. The DDA wave number results are compared to the ones computed with single electric or single magnetic dipole approximation and to the ones retrieved by using the Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) retrieval method from reflection and transmission of finite thickness slabs computed by a full-wave simulation. It is shown that the DDA method is in very good agreement with NRW, in contrast to the previously reported single dipole approximation methods that fail to predict one of the two features (either electric or magnetic). A mode with transverse polarization is found to be dominant and able to propagate inside the lattice, and therefore the composite material can be treated as a homogeneous one with effective refractive index. This is obtained by adopting five different retrieval procedures for each lattice, and their agreement or disagreement is discussed.},

Porous silicon has been fabricated by both “top-down” techniques from solid silicon and “bottom-up” routes from silicon atoms and silicon-based molecules. Over the last 50 years, electrochemical etching has been the most developed approach for chip-based applications and has been utilized to create highly directional mesoporosity (pore diameters in the range 2–50 nm) and macroporosity (pore diameters {\textgreater}50 nm). Recently, chemical conversion of porous or solid silica using magnesium vapor has received much attention for applications that require inexpensive mesoporous silicon in powder form. Very few techniques are currently available for creating wholly microporous silicon with pore size below 2 nm.},

The sensor operates by measurement of the Fabry−Perot fringes in the white light reflection spectrum from the porous silicon layer. Molecular binding is detected as a shift in wavelength of these fringes. IgG was added to and removed from the protein A-modified surface by changing solution pH in a flow cell, and the system was found to be reversible through several on−off cycles. The molecule used to link protein A to the porous Si surface incorporated bovine serum albumin (BSA). This approach was found to completely eliminate signal due to nonspecific binding, tested by exposure of the sensor to the F(ab‘)2 fragment of IgG (which does not bind to protein A). The linker/protein A-modified surface was also found to be stable toward oxidation in the aqueous buffer solutions used. The shift in the Fabry−Perot fringes was found to scale with the mass of analyte bound in the porous Si layer.},

When an external electric field is applied across an electrically floating Au electrode immersed in a bipolar electrochemical cell, a position-dependent interfacial potential difference is generated along the length of the Au. This potential gradient can be used to induce variations of chemical composition within thin films electrodeposited onto the Au bipolar electrode (BPE). Thin films formed by bipolar electrodeposition represent continuous one-dimensional solid-state material libraries and were screened using resonance Raman microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. As predicted from simple thermodynamic considerations, we observed three distinct deposition zones scanning from the cathodic pole to the midpoint of the BPE: (i) CdS+Cd, (ii) stoichiometric CdS, and (iii) elemental S. Bipolar electrodeposition can be used to generate material libraries rapidly and without direct electrical contact to the substrate using extremely simple instrumentation.},

	abstract = {We report the synthesis of Ag−Au alloy gradients on stainless steel substrates using bipolar electrodeposition (BP-ED), a technique based on the existence of a potential gradient at the interface of a bipolar electrode (BPE) and an electrolytic solution. The interfacial potential gradient causes the rates of electrodeposition of Ag and Au to vary along the length of the BPE, leading to the electrodeposition of a chemical concentration gradient. The surface morphology of the electrodeposits was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and their chemical composition was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Self-assembled monolayers of a Raman-active probe molecule (benzene thiol) were allowed to form on the surface of the alloy gradients, and confocal Raman microscopy was employed to determine the alloy composition that resulted in the maximum surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) intensity. An alloy composition of ca. 70\% Ag/30\% Au was found to be optimum for SERS excited using 514.5 nm radiation, and it is explained on the basis of composition-dependent changes in the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the electrodeposited Ag−Au alloy.},

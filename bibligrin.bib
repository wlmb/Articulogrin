The orientational structure and energetic properties of the liquid have been studied for several choices of Ewald sum parameters. The results, including the dielectric constant epsilon-o, the radial-dependent Kirkwood factor G(k)(r), the orientational projection H-DELTA-(r), and the average dipole interaction energy, are compared with those from molecular dynamics simulations of water using the reaction field method. While the orientational structure of the liquid obtained from simulations which treat long range interactions by Ewald summation is different from corresponding results obtained from simulations with a reaction field, consistent values are calculated for the dielectric constant. The sensitivity of the results to variations in the convergence parameter alpha, the real-space cutoff R(c), and the number of vectors used in the reciprocal space sum was also analyzed.},

Then we use the developed theory to analyze the modes with real and complex wave number in a 3D periodic lattice of lead telluride (PbTe) microspheres at infrared frequencies and in a 3D periodic lattice of titanium dioxide (TiO2) microspheres at millimeter waves. Each microsphere is equivalently modeled with both an electric and a magnetic dipole, via a method here called the dual dipole approximation (DDA). The 3D lattices exhibit first a magnetic-induced then an electric-induced feature determined by microsphere magnetic and electric resonances. The DDA wave number results are compared to the ones computed with single electric or single magnetic dipole approximation and to the ones retrieved by using the Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) retrieval method from reflection and transmission of finite thickness slabs computed by a full-wave simulation. It is shown that the DDA method is in very good agreement with NRW, in contrast to the previously reported single dipole approximation methods that fail to predict one of the two features (either electric or magnetic). A mode with transverse polarization is found to be dominant and able to propagate inside the lattice, and therefore the composite material can be treated as a homogeneous one with effective refractive index. This is obtained by adopting five different retrieval procedures for each lattice, and their agreement or disagreement is discussed.},

These dipole sums are conditionally convergent, which means that they depend on the order of summation (i.e., the shape of the crystal). Rapidly converging expressions for these sums are obtained with the method of planewise summation, for lattices of arbitrary symmetry and arbitrary dipole orientation. With these expressions one can evaluate the internal field at an arbitrary point of complex dipole lattices. As an example, the internal electric field at the positions of the water molecules is evaluated for potassium ferrocyanide [K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O].},

	abstract = {An equation originally derived by Lennard-Jones and Dent for the estimation of Madelung potentials is utilized to study the properties of these potentials within the bulk and at the surfaces of crystals. It is clear from the equation that potentials at atomic sites only one lattice constant distant from the surface are, in general, indistinguishable from those in the bulk. The equation indicates also that Madelung sums in real space can be so organized as to make them more tractable computationally than they are usually considered to be. Madelung potentials for atomic sites at and near surfaces are obtained for NaCl(100), NaCl(110), CsCl(110), zinc blende (110), wurtzite (11¯20), and rutile (001).},

- A simple expression was found for computing the current density during the
  etching process of layered porous silicon systems with lateral
  gradients.

- The expression is an exponentially fast converging series, each term
  of which is given by a simple analytical formula.

- Full calibration curves for porosity and etching rate can be
  obtained from measurements on different positions along the surface
  of a single sample.

- Useful for the design and fabrication of multilayered PS GRIN optical
  devices with a lateral gradient of refractive indices and layer
  thicknesses.
